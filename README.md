### Input Features (8 Parameters)
- Vehicle Speed (km/h)
- Longitudinal Acceleration (m/s²)
- Vertical Acceleration (m/s²)
- Mass Air Flow (g/s)
- Engine Load (%)
- Engine RPM
- Manifold Absolute Pressure (kPa)
- Intake Air Temperature (°C)

### Road Surface Classes
- **Class 0**: Smooth Condition (μ = 0.8) - Dry asphalt, high friction
- **Class 1**: Uneven Condition (μ = 0.4) - Wet pavement, moderate friction
- **Class 2**: Full of Holes (μ = 0.1) - Icy/gravel surfaces, low friction



# Real-time prediction
sensor_data = {
    'vehicle_speed': 45.0,
    'longitudinal_accel': -2.1,
    'vertical_accel': 0.3,
    'mass_air_flow': 15.2,
    'engine_load': 35.0,
    'engine_rpm': 2100,
    'manifold_pressure': 85.0,
    'intake_temp': 25.0
}

# Predict road surface and get friction coefficient
road_class = classifier.predict(sensor_data)
friction_coeff = abs_system.get_friction_coefficient(road_class)

print(f"Predicted road surface: {road_class}")
print(f"Friction coefficient: {friction_coeff}")

## 📈 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing (Python):**
   - Normalize and impute vehicle sensor data
   - Balance classes for road surface

2. **Model Training (MATLAB):**
   - Trained using Classification Learner
   - Exported to `roadPredictor.mdl`

3. **Simulation (Simulink):**
   - Vehicle dynamics modeled
   - Friction is estimated from predicted class
   - Braking control adjusts based on slip and μ

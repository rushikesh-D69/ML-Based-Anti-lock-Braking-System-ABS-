## âš™ Initial Parameters

Before running the simulation, the following variables **must be initialized** in the MATLAB workspace:



```matlab
g = 9.8;     % Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)
l = 5;       % Wheelbase or lever arm (meters)
m = 75;      % Mass of the vehicle (kg)
R = 1.25;    % Wheel radius (meters)
v0 = 44;     % Initial vehicle speed (km/h or m/s based on model)
